# 🚨 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions  

Welcome to the **Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions** project! 🎉  
This project aims to build a web application that can detect fraudulent transactions using the **Isolation Forest algorithm**. It also provides interactive visualizations of the detection results to make it easier to identify and analyze potential fraud cases.

## 🔎 Project Overview  

- 📌 **Purpose**:  
  This project is designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically the **Isolation Forest algorithm**. The system provides a web-based platform where users can upload transaction data, view results, and interact with visualizations of potential fraud cases.

- 💡 **Core Features**:  
  - **Transaction Upload**: Users can upload transaction datasets in CSV format.  
  - **Fraud Detection**: The system automatically detects fraudulent transactions using the Isolation Forest algorithm.  
  - **Interactive Visualizations**: Visualizations to analyze detected fraud cases with various metrics and insights.  
  - **Result Download**: Users can download the results after fraud detection in a CSV format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Frontend**:  
  - **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**: For creating the user interface and interactions.  
  - **Chart.js**: For visualizing results interactively.  

- **Backend**:  
  - **Django**: Web framework for building the backend and handling server-side logic.  
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.  
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the Isolation Forest algorithm.  
  - **NumPy**: For handling numerical operations.

## 🚀 Features  

- **Upload Transaction Data**:  
  Users can upload CSV files containing transaction data (e.g., transaction ID, amount, timestamp, etc.).  

- **Fraud Detection**:  
  The system runs the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.  

- **Visualizations**:  
  - Graphs to visualize fraud detection results, such as percentage of fraudulent transactions.  
  - Data distribution to understand patterns in legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions.  

- **Download Results**:  
  After detection, users can download a CSV file containing the flagged fraudulent transactions.
