## 🔎 Project Overview  

- 📌 **Purpose**:  
  The main goal of this project is to develop a web application that can detect fraud in financial transactions using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm. The frontend is built with **React** for dynamic user interaction and data visualization.

- 💡 **Core Features**:  
  - Upload and process transaction data files (CSV, Excel).
  - Detect potential fraudulent transactions based on machine learning predictions.
  - Visualize results interactively, such as graphs and charts for analysis.
  - Responsive UI for a seamless experience across devices.

## 🚀 Features  

- **Data Upload**:  
  Users can upload transaction data in CSV or Excel format, which is then processed for fraud detection.

- **Fraud Detection**:  
  The system uses the **Isolation Forest** algorithm to predict whether each transaction is fraudulent or not.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:  
  Users can view results through interactive charts and graphs, making it easier to understand the analysis.

- **Responsive Design**:  
  The frontend adjusts dynamically to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, or desktop.
